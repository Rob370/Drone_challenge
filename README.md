# Drone_challenge
For semplicity, clarity and habit I created this repository containing the .py code to analyse data, some references used for the solution of the different tasks and finally some plots useful for the general understanding.
Specifically data_analysis_1 was used to answer to the first 2 questions of the Task 3 - Data Analysis, while data_analysis_2 was used to answer to the last 3 questions.

Note: I did not upload the .csv file because too big, but originally is present in the same folder as the other files (important for the path loading in the code) in my Desktop.
