# Drone_challenge
For semplicity, clarity and habit I created this repository containing the .csv file, the .py code to analyse data, some references used for the solution of the different tasks and finally some plots useful for the general understanding.
Specifically data_analysis_1 was used to answer to the first 2 questions of the Task 3 - Data Analysis, while data_analysis_2 was used to answer to the last 3 questions.
